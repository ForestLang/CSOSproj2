description:
Place to put the files for banker's algorithm code.  There should be:
* a file with a main that runs the algorithm
* an input file storing values from the provided table
* this readme
you should only have to compile the file with the main in it to run the program.
things have not been added yet, because don't yet exist in a way I am happy with, but they will and when they are this readme should be updated.
