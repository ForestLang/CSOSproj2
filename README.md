description:
Place to put the files for banker's algorithm code.  

The repository should contain:
* a file with a main that runs the algorithm (main.cpp)
* an input file storing values from the provided table (in.cpp)
* this readme

you should only have to compile the file with the main in it to run the program.   
(g++ -o runner main.cpp    ./runner)
